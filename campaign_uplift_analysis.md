# A. USER SEGMENTATION

Funnel-relevant events mapped to users:

```sql
CREATE VIEW user_events AS
SELECT 	u.user_id,
	    ei.event_name,
	    e.event_time
FROM events e
JOIN event_identifier ei ON ei.event_type = e.event_type
JOIN users u ON u.cookie_id = e.cookie_id
WHERE ei.event_name IN ('Ad Impression', 'Ad Click', 'Purchase');
```

Users were segmented into mutually exclusive exposure groups ('Non-exposed', 'Impression-only', 'Clickers'):

```sql
CREATE VIEW user_segmentation AS
SELECT	u.user_id,
	    c.campaign_id,
	    c.campaign_name,
	
	    MAX(CASE WHEN u.event_name = 'Ad Impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_impression,
	    MAX(CASE WHEN u.event_name = 'Ad Click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_click,
	    MAX(CASE WHEN u.event_name = 'Purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_purchase,

		CASE
			WHEN MAX(CASE WHEN u.event_name = 'Ad Impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
				THEN 'Non-exposed'
	        WHEN MAX(CASE WHEN u.event_name = 'Ad Impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 1
	            AND MAX(CASE WHEN u.event_name = 'Ad Click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
	            THEN 'Impression-only'
	        WHEN MAX(CASE WHEN u.event_name = 'Ad Click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 1
	            THEN 'Clicker'
		END AS user_segmentation 
		
FROM user_events u
JOIN campaign_identifier c ON u.event_time 
	BETWEEN c.start_date AND c.end_date
GROUP BY u.user_id, c.campaign_id, c.campaign_name

SELECT *
FROM user_segmentation;
```

| user_id | campaign_id | campaign_name                          | has_impression | has_click | has_purchase | user_segmentation |

# B. FUNNEL METRICS

## 1. Funnel metrics by user group

```sql
CREATE VIEW campaign_funnel_metrics AS
SELECT 	campaign_id,
        campaign_name,
			
		COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_users,
		COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS impression_users,
		COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN has_click = 1 THEN user_id END) AS click_users,
		COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN has_click = 1 AND has_purchase = 1 THEN user_id END) AS purchase_users,

		ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN has_click = 1 THEN user_id END) 
			/ NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id), 0)::NUMERIC, 4) AS ctr,
		ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN has_click = 1 AND has_purchase = 1 THEN user_id END)
			/ NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN has_click = 1 THEN user_id END),0)::NUMERIC, 4) AS purchase_cr,
		ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN has_click = 1 AND has_purchase = 1 THEN user_id END)
			/ NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id), 0)::NUMERIC, 4) AS overall_funnel_cr		
			
FROM user_segmentation
WHERE has_impression = 1
GROUP BY campaign_id, campaign_name;
SELECT *
FROM campaign_funnel_metrics;
```

| campaign_id | campaign_name | impression_users | click_users | purchase_users | ctr | purchase_cr | overall_funnel_cr |
|------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | BOGOF - Fishing For Compliments | 59 | 50 | 49 | 0.8475 | 0.9800 | 0.8305 |
| 2 | 25% Off - Living The Lux Life | 91 | 71 | 65 | 0.7802 | 0.9155 | 0.7143 |
| 3 | Half Off - Treat Your Shelf(ing) | 352 | 307 | 305 | 0.8722 | 0.9935 | 0.8665 |

## 2. Overall funnel metrics

```sql
CREATE VIEW funnel_metrics AS
SELECT 	SUM(impression_users) AS impression_users,
		SUM(click_users) AS click_users,
		SUM(purchase_users) AS purchase_users,

		ROUND(SUM(click_users) / NULLIF(SUM(impression_users),0)::NUMERIC, 4) AS ctr,
		ROUND(SUM(purchase_users) / NULLIF(SUM(click_users),0)::NUMERIC, 4) AS purchase_cr,
		ROUND(SUM(purchase_users) / NULLIF(SUM(impression_users),0)::NUMERIC, 4) AS overall_funnel_cr			
			
FROM campaign_funnel_metrics;

|------------------|-------------|----------------|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 502 | 428 | 419 | 0.8526 | 0.9790 | 0.8347 |

# C. PURCHASE UPLIFT ANALYSIS

**Treated_users**: Users who received at least one Ad Impression

```sql
treated_users AS (
	  SELECT DISTINCT user_id
	  FROM user_events
	  WHERE event_name = 'Ad Impression'
)
```

**Control_users**: Users who never received any Ad Impression

```sql
control_users AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT u.user_id
	FROM users u
	WHERE u.user_id NOT IN (
		SELECT user_id FROM treated_users)
)
```

**Purchase_users**: Users who made at least one Purchase event

```sql
purchase_users AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id
    FROM user_events
    WHERE event_name = 'Purchase'
)
```

## 1. Purchase rate by treatment group

```sql
purchase_rate AS (
    SELECT	'Treated' AS user_group,
			COUNT(DISTINCT t.user_id) AS total_users,
			COUNT(DISTINCT p.user_id) AS purchasers,
			ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT p.user_id)::NUMERIC
				/ COUNT(DISTINCT t.user_id),4) AS purchase_rate
	FROM treated_users t
	LEFT JOIN purchase_users p ON t.user_id = p.user_id

	UNION ALL

	SELECT
		'Control' AS user_group,
		COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id),
		COUNT(DISTINCT p.user_id),
		ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT p.user_id)::NUMERIC 
		/ COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id),4) AS purchase_rate
	FROM control_users c
	LEFT JOIN purchase_users p ON c.user_id = p.user_id
)
SELECT * 
FROM purchase_rate;
```

| user_group | total_users | purchasers | purchase_rate |
|------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **Treated** | 442 | 439 | **0.9932** |
| **Control** | 58 | 45 | **0.7759** |

## 2. Purchase uplift: Treated - Control

```sql
uplift_analysis AS (
    SELECT	MAX(CASE WHEN user_group = 'Treated' THEN purchase_rate END) AS treated_purchase_rate,
			MAX(CASE WHEN user_group = 'Control' THEN purchase_rate END) AS control_purchase_rate,
			MAX(CASE WHEN user_group = 'Treated' THEN purchase_rate END)
			-
			MAX(CASE WHEN user_group = 'Control' THEN purchase_rate END)
				AS purchase_uplift
	FROM purchase_rate
)
SELECT * 
FROM uplift_analysis;
```

| treated_purchase_rate | control_purchase_rate | purchase_uplift |
|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **0.9932** | **0.7759** | **0.2173** |
