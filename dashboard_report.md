# Power BI Dashboard — Campaign Funnel & Uplift Analysis

This Power BI report provides a comprehensive view of how marketing campaigns influence user behavior, product interaction, and purchase conversion. 
The dashboard integrates SQL-based user segmentation, funnel metrics, and uplift analysis to evaluate campaign performance across impression, click, 
and purchase stages.

### 1. Funnel Efficiency

The Overall Purchase Conversion Rate is 86.4%  Once a user shows intent (Clicks), the conversion probability is virtually absolute. This indicates that the Landing Page and Checkout flow are fully optimized.
- **Action**: Stop optimizing the checkout process. Instead, reallocate 100% of the optimization budget to Top-of-Funnel (ToF) activities to drive more Impressions.

### 2. Consumer Behavior
The Half Off and BOGOF campaigns achieved superior conversion rates (86.7% and 84.8% respectively). Customers are far more responsive to "deep discounts" (50%) or "gift-with-purchase" mechanics than to moderate percentage discounts.
- **Action**: Consider adjusting the content of the 25% Off campaign or switching to more attractive promotional formats to maximize conversion efficiency.

### 3. Product Performance
Lobster leads the catalog with a 77.9% purchase rate, followed closely by Oyster and Kingfish. Customers show a distinct tendency to purchase fresh, easy-to-prepare seafood items. Despite being a premium product, Russian Caviar has the lowest purchase rate (73.7%) on this list.
- **Action**: Pivot visuals and marketing content to specifically target the "Lux Life" segment rather than mass audiences.  

### 4. Monthly Performance
While February showed peak performance, March experienced a drastic ~90% drop in impressions and sales. The decline in sales is not due to diminishing ad quality, but stems directly from the massive drop in Impressions. This pattern confirms the business currently relies too heavily on short-term events or temporary campaigns (likely peaking around Tet/Valentine's Day).
- **Immediate Investigation**: Determine if the drop is due to budget exhaustion or a natural decline in market interest post-holiday.
- **Action**: Develop a distributed marketing plan to ensure a baseline of traffic. The goal is to avoid revenue free-fall following peak periods and smooth out these monthly fluctuations.


## 2. Campaign Details

### Campaign Overview
#### 1. The Revenue Star: Half Off - Treat Your Shellf(ish)
It accounted for 82% of total impressions (353/426) and maintained a stellar conversion rate (CR) of 68%. The Click Abandonment rate was virtually zero (only 2 drops out of 308 clicks).

The 50% discount holds strong mass appeal and fits the preferences of the vast majority of users. It trigger impulse buying without raising doubts about product value.

- **Action**:
  - Reallocate the majority of the ad budget (70-80%) to this campaign to maximize revenue.    - Target Lookalike Audiences based on the behavior of users who clicked or purchased from this campaign to find new high-potential customers.

#### 2. The Potential Candidate: BOGOF - Fishing For Compliments
Despite having the lowest Impressions (66), it achieved the highest Click-Through Rate (87.9%) across the system. 

The keywords "Free" or "Buy 1 Get 1" act as powerful psychological triggers. Even with limited exposure, the high engagement rate proves that customers are highly motivated by the perceived value of a "gift."

- **Action**:
    - Inventory Clearance: Use for new product launches or to clear inventory quickly.
    - Bundling: Bundle with premium products to increase Average Order Value (AOV).
    - Email Marketing: Send exclusive BOGOF offers to the existing customer list to drive repeat purchases and re-engage dormant users.
 
#### 3. The Weak Link: 25% Off - Living The Lux Life
This campaign was the lowest performer across the board (CTR 77.6%, CR 72.4%) and suffered from the highest abandonment rates.

For the premium/luxury customer segment, a 25% discount is not compelling. These customers are more sensitive to "Exclusive Value" than to minor price reductions.

- **Action**:
    - A/B Test Content: Compare the effectiveness of "25% Off" versus "Save 1/4" messaging.
    - Retargeting: Target users who viewed but did not click with the higher-converting BOGOF offer to re-engage them.
    - Conditional Kill: If the above tactics fail to improve metrics, permanently eliminate the campaign to prevent budget wastage on a low-efficiency funnel.

### Monthly Trends
The timeline chart provides definitive proof that the campaign rotation strategy optimized efficiency, but failed on volume maintenance.

| Month | Strategy | Conversion Rate | Result |
|------:|---------:|----------------:|--------|
| January | 25% Off + BOGOF | 76.3% | Moderate performance dragged down by the weak 25% offer. |
| February | Half Off | 86.7% | Performance Spike. Removing the weak link boosted overall efficiency significantly. |
| March | Half Off | 87.0% | Peak Efficiency / Volume Crash. CR hit an all-time high, proving the ad creative is still fresh. The sales drop is strictly due to a lack of Impression volume.|

Contrary to a typical post-holiday slump where engagement metrics fade, the campaign Conversion Rate actually climbed to a record high of 87.0% in March. This divergence —low volume despite high efficiency — confirms that the revenue drop was not driven by ad fatigue or diminishing quality. Instead, it exposes a structural vulnerability: the business is over-indexed on short-term bursts (likely Tet/Valentine’s), leaving it prone to instability when campaign budgets are paused.
- **Action**:
    - **Immediate Investigation**: Audit the ad accounts to distinguish between forced budget caps versus a strategic pause in spending.
    - **Action**: Switch to a consistent marketing plan. Maintain an "Always-On" budget to keep traffic steady and avoid sudden revenue drops.
